# Coding Universe

Shared conventions for Wright Strategy development repositories. This resident block is
**defaults and tripwires only** (ADR-028). Reference payload:
`docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md`. Workflow policy lives in the skill that owns the workflow.

## Standing defaults

- **Mindset:** GitOps — git is the source of truth; declarative over manual.
- **Communication:** write for the operator, who has not loaded your skills or vocabulary.
  Lead with what changed and what you need from them; a term of art appears only beside its
  plain meaning. If a report needs "now in English, what did you do?", it failed.
- **Ordinary tier (ADR-026):** write implementation yourself, in-session; a different
  model family reviews it before the human merge gate. Parallelism or isolation, when a task
  earns it, runs on Orca orchestration inside a ready runtime — never a hidden host subagent
  or a silent executor CLI. Workers never dispatch onward and are released before teardown.
  ADRs, specs, and plans you always write yourself.
- **Review gates:** no implementation PR meets the human gate without `ws-dev:pr-review`;
  no finished spec or plan without `ws-dev:doc-review`. One exemption: **Tiny** work
  (trivial, behavior-preserving — CI is the check) may skip the agent review; when in
  doubt it is not Tiny. Every departure exists only on the gate record — a silent skip is
  never a waiver. Gate policy, waiver classes, and declared post-verdict deltas live in those
  skills.
- **Work management (ADR-029):** org work lives in Linear (`ws-dev:linear`) — planned work files
  complete into Backlog; only bugs get priority. Blocked until it lands? file to Todo +
  `agent-waiting`, saying what is blocked. A mid-task **discovery is a hypothesis, not work**:
  file it to **Triage** with the discovery template + your exponential estimate; the nightly
  pass adjudicates — never promote your own finding to Backlog
  (`docs/standards/work-management.md#agent-discovery-triage`). Route by the repository's
  `linear_team`; multi-repo teams require its `repo:` label. Repos with
  `change_control = "platform"` use **PLT** and `ws-dev:repo-request`. Never a GitHub issue — GitHub keeps code, PRs, CI; link
  PRs to their Linear issue so state syncs on merge.
- **Secrets:** never in git — commit `.env.example`, keep values in 1Password / SOPS / GitHub
  Environments. Apps fail fast on missing config; prefer OIDC or short-lived tokens.
- **Python:** always `uv`, never pip; commit `uv.lock`; never commit `.venv/`.
- **TypeScript:** Bun, never Node, for agent and scripting code; commit `bun.lock`;
  `"strict": true`.
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits, imperative subject <70 chars, body says *why*. A
  deploy-affecting commit (env var, migration, job, cutover order, out-of-app step) ends with
  a `Deploy:` trailer. Agent commits carry `Authored-By: Claude|Codex|Grok` (reconciliation:
  `Reconciled-By:`); `Co-Authored-By:` only for an agent that wrote shipped bytes.
- **Testing:** `bun test` / `pytest`; test names describe behavior; real dependencies over
  mocks that can drift.
- **CI runners:** private-repo CI defaults to `runs-on: [self-hosted, ci]` (fresh isolated
  VM, no LAN route); GitHub-hosted is a documented exception.
- **Runtime:** one foreground process, stdout/stderr logs, clean `SIGTERM`; HTTP services
  expose `/healthz` and `/readyz`; migrations are explicit, idempotent deploy steps.
- **Docs:** living docs are the only authority and update with implementation; a decision
  lands as a living-doc edit plus a dated `docs/decisions.md` entry in the same PR (ADRs are
  a frozen archive — never write or supersede one). Before finishing: `ws-dev:doc-audit`, or
  state `docs not needed: <reason>`.
- **Releases:** Python: python-semantic-release, tag-only, dispatched; JS/TS: Changesets;
  release-please is deprecated. Notes let a deployer bump a pin without reading source:
  `Deploy:` items lead, then breaking changes and the image index digest.
- **Platform repos (ADR-029):** from outside the platform stream never write `bridge`, `homelab`,
  `dotfiles`, or the homelab cluster — no clone, PR, `kubectl`, SSH; file PLT. Inside it, write
  all three.
- **Instruction files:** `AGENTS.md` is each repo's canonical guidance; `CLAUDE.md` is the
  one-line `@AGENTS.md` stub. Repo-specific guidance stays outside the generated block;
  scaffold with `repo-bootstrap`.

## Tripwires

| Before you… | Read |
|---|---|
| write GitHub Actions beyond runner tier, `timeout-minutes`, one-run-per-change | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#github-actions` |
| write any `concurrency:` stanza, merge-queue config, or deploy workflow | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#concurrency-and-merge-queues` |
| write Dockerfiles, container CI, or release-promote flows | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#container-images--ci` |
| ship images or touch secret-scan gates | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#supply-chain-integrity` |
| edit Dependabot/Renovate config, registries, or osv-scanner | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#dependency-updates` |
| set up release automation, cut a release, or hotfix production | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#versioning--releases` |
| touch GitHub Packages auth (a 403 on "correct" config is this) | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#github-packages` |
| adopt graphify or change graph commit/ignore rules | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#knowledge-graph-graphify` |
| build or modify a web app | `wrightstrategy/web-ui` — shared UI spine, `create-app`, earn-its-place |
| parallelize or isolate work in an Orca runtime | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#parallel-and-isolated-work` |
| work in an Orca worktree | `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#orca-worktree-checkpoints` |
| record, waive, or depart from any review gate | `ws-dev:pr-review` / `ws-dev:doc-review` |
| need filing/routing rules beyond the two destinations | `docs/standards/work-management.md` (in `wrightstrategy/bridge`) |
