# Coding Universe

Shared Wright Strategy rules: **Binding** boundaries cannot be weakened locally;
**Default** choices apply unless replaced in root `AGENTS.md` → `Local departures`.
Record the default, scope, replacement, and reason outside generated blocks. Definitions
and format: `docs/agents/ws-dev-reference.md#standard-authority-and-local-departures`.
Workflow policy stays in its owning skill; local departures never waive gates or checks.

<a id="standing-defaults"></a>

## Standing rules

- **Default — Mindset:** GitOps — git is the source of truth; declarative over manual.
- **Default — Communication:** write for the operator. Lead with what changed and what you
  need from them; explain terms beside their plain meaning.
- **Default — Ordinary work:** write implementation yourself, in-session.
- **Binding — Agent roles:** primary authors write plans/specs; earned parallelism or isolation
  uses Orca orchestration in a ready runtime, never hidden host subagents or silent executor
  CLIs. Workers never dispatch onward and are released before teardown. Shipped work meets
  the owning review gate however it was produced.
- **Binding — Review gates:** use `ws-dev:pr-review` for implementation PRs and
  `ws-dev:doc-review` for finished specs/plans before the human gate. Tiny work
  (trivial, behavior-preserving) and other exceptions use only the owning skill's recorded
  paths. Every departure belongs on the gate record; a silent skip is never a waiver.
- **Binding — Work management:** before filing development work, use `ws-dev:linear` and
  its canonical `docs/standards/work-management.md` filing contract in bridge. Platform
  requests use `ws-dev:repo-request`. Track agent work in Linear, never GitHub issues;
  link PRs to Linear.
- **Binding — Secrets:** never in git.
- **Default — Configuration:** commit `.env.example`; keep values in 1Password / SOPS /
  GitHub Environments. Fail fast on missing config; prefer OIDC or short-lived tokens,
  subject to applicable security/authentication contracts.
- **Default — Python:** use `uv`, not pip; commit `uv.lock`; never commit `.venv/`.
- **Default — TypeScript:** Bun for agent/scripting code; commit `bun.lock`; `"strict": true`.
- **Default — Commits:** Conventional Commits, imperative subject <70 chars; body says why.
- **Binding — Attribution:** agent commits carry truthful `Authored-By: Claude|Codex|Grok`
  (reconciliation: `Reconciled-By:`); `Co-Authored-By:` only for authors of shipped bytes.
- **Binding — Deploy steps:** record required external actions (env, migration, job, cutover,
  out-of-app step) in `deploy/deploy_next.md` in the same PR; edit superseded entries in place.
  Follow the reference's existing migration scope for repos still on `Deploy:` trailers.
- **Default — Testing:** `bun test` / `pytest`; behavioral test names; real dependencies over
  mocks that can drift. Required checks and verification obligations remain in force.
- **Default — CI runners:** private CI uses `runs-on: [self-hosted, ci]` (fresh VM, no LAN);
  document GitHub-hosted exceptions. Generated workflows remain generator-owned.
- **Default — Runtime:** one foreground process, stdout/stderr logs, clean `SIGTERM`;
  HTTP `/healthz` + `/readyz`; explicit, idempotent migrations. Preserve actual consumer contracts.
- **Binding — Docs:** reconcile living/reference docs with changes. Decisions land in their
  living home plus dated `docs/decisions.md` entries; ADRs are frozen (never extend or supersede).
  Finish with `ws-dev:doc-audit` or `docs not needed: <reason>`.
- **Default — Releases:** Python: python-semantic-release, tag-only, dispatched; JS/TS:
  Changesets. release-please is deprecated; migrate when release tooling is touched.
- **Binding — Release information:** accurate deployment changes, breaking changes and image
  index digest let a deployer bump a pin without reading source. Preserve published interfaces.
- **Binding — Platform:** outside the platform stream never write `bridge`, `homelab`,
  `dotfiles`, or the cluster (no clone, PR, `kubectl`, SSH); file PLT. Inside it, write all three
  under the target repo's own gates. Existing owner-authorized exceptions retain their scope.
- **Binding — Instruction files:** `AGENTS.md` is canonical; `CLAUDE.md` is the one-line
  `@AGENTS.md` adapter. Generated content changes at its source, via `repo-bootstrap`.
- **Default — Local guidance:** smallest useful layout outside generated blocks.
- **Binding — Graphify:** for adopters, PRs never change `graphify-out/`; regeneration and
  committed cleanup belong to the existing main-side job.

## Local departures

- **Default:** [Container workflow choice](https://github.com/wrightstrategy/bridge/blob/main/conventions/dev-reference.md#container-images--ci).
  **Scope:** this public repository's image and release workflows.
  **Replacement:** repository-local workflows on GitHub-hosted runners preserve the binding
  test, scan, provenance/SBOM, image-identity, and release-tag contracts.
  **Reason:** a public caller cannot access Bridge's private reusable workflows; public
  repositories are excluded from the private runner pool. No private workflow is published.
- **Default:** [Release lanes](https://github.com/wrightstrategy/bridge/blob/main/conventions/dev-reference.md#python-python-semantic-release-tag-only-from-a-dispatched-workflow).
  **Scope:** this app's initial formal release automation.
  **Replacement:** stable releases from main only, using the pinned tag-only tool and App
  token; version identity comes from git tags, without package-version stamping.
  **Reason:** the app is un-packaged scripts with one deployment line; additional release
  trains and a packaging/version API would add unused interfaces. See docs/RELEASING.md.
